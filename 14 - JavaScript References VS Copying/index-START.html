    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2);

    age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    // console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3]="lux";

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // it updates team and players

    // now here is the problem!
    // because we updated team, but team is a reference to original array. if you update either array its going to go back to original reference

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[3] = 'Me';

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
        name: 'Cara C',
        age: 27
    };

    // with Objects
    const captain = person;
    // captain.age = 99; // also updates original

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 99, number: 37 });

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person} // not working yet

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
